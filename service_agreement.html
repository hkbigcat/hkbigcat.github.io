              <p>DCM shall not sell or otherwise provide Member’s personal 
                data to any third party, or make any other use of Member’s personal 
                data, protected under the Data Protection (Privacy) Ordinance, for 
                any purpose which is not incidental to the use of DCM services by 
                Member.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding the above, Member agrees to allow DCM 
                to collect the details provided by Member on the Service Subscription

                necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or any agency responsible 
                for government or public security in the performance of their functions; 
                or</p>
              <p>iii) DCM are required by law to disclose the data.</p>
              <p>DCM shall make their best endeavours to keep the confidentiality 
                of all personal data collected by DCM. However, DCM do not warrant 
                and cannot ensure the security of any data which Member transmits 
                to DCM.</p>

                this Clause 4 and Clause 8 shall continue in force and effect and 
                continue thereafter to subsist for so long as may be necessary for

                of this Agreement. The Member shall keep DCM fully and effectually 
                indemnified against any loss and damages which DCM may suffer as
