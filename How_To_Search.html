    <h1>General Guidelines</h1>

    <p>This advanced and 
      powerful search engine made it possible for you to search within 
      the database in English and Chinese. You will soon discover how 
      much searching time and effort you could save. To get started, make 
      sure you read carefully the following general guideline for search 
      string input.</p>
    <p>(1) Search in Chinese:<br>
      In Hong Kong, names of both defendants &amp; plaintiffs in civil 
      litigations are usually in English rather than in Chinese. At present, 
      less than 2% of the records is in Chinese. Should you wish to search 
      in Chinese, please select “Chinese (Hong Kong) 中文(中國香港特別行政區)[zh-hk]” 
      and “Big 5繁體中文” as your language and encoding respectively.</p>
    <p>(2) Punctuation<br>
      Please skip all punctuation in your data input. For example, “Sample 
      (H.K.) Ltd.” should be inputted as “Sample HK Ltd” except the following 
      situations<br>
      i/: “apostrophe s” e.g. Cheung's Co Ltd <br>
      ii/: “dot com” e.g. Tom.com </p>
    <p>(3) The prefix “The”<br>
      Just skip all “The” prefix in your data input.</p>
    <p>(4) Abbreviations<br>
      Abbreviations are acceptable only for the following terms as input 
      string equivalent to their full spellings. This system will indicate 
      all records matched against your inputted abbreviations and the 
      corresponding full spellings.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Abbreviations which will be recognized by the system:<br>
      <br>
      </u> And/&amp;; Building/Bldg; Company/Co; Corporation/Corp; Far 
      East/FE; Hong Kong/HK; Industry/Ind; Incorporation/Inc; International/Intl; 
      Kowloon/Kln; Limited/Ltd; Development/Dev; Factory/Fty; Investment/Inv; 
      Saint/St; Import/I; Export/E; Manufacturing/Mfg; Manufactory/Mfy</p>
    <p>Other adopted abbreviations:<br>
      AKA = Also know as<br>
      BTA = Both trading as<br>
      FKA = Formerly known as<br>
      FTA = Formerly trading as<br>
      TA = Trading as<br>
      WO = Winding up order (清盤令)<br>
      BO = Bankruptcy order / Adjudication order (破產令)<br>
      AO = Annulment order (撤銷清盤 / 破產令)</p>
    <p>(5) Personal Name<br>
      For a personal name search, enter the surname first. For a foreigner’s 
      name search in which you cannot identify which word is surname, 
      please try more combinations. For example: Benson John David or 
      David Benson John.</p>
    <p>As aliases of defendants 
      are not necessarily filed in writs records, just skip the aliases 
      when input search string (e.g. “Chan Tai Man Tony” should be inputted 
      as “Chan Tai Man”).</p>
    <br>
   
    <p><strong>How to search</strong></p>
    <p>(1) Exact Name Search</p>

    </ol>
    </p>
     
    <p><strong>Special notes</strong></p>
    <p>Neither the defendant is liable 
      nor the plaintiff is eligible to the claim until a judgement is 
      reached.</p>
    <p>The outcome of a civil litigation 
      is difficult to trace as records of judgement and suit discontinuance 
      are not disclosed to the public. Even a defendant has repaid the 
      claimed amount in full, that particular litigation record will not 
      be automatically deleted from the suit records.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, the ID card no. of 
      a defendant in a civil litigation or bankruptcy would not be released 
      to the public. Defendants of similar spellings in different civil 
      litigations may not be one &amp; the same person.</p>
    <p>Unlimited Companies may bear similar 
      names as long as they have different registration numbers. Thus, 
      corporate defendants(of such nature) with similar names appearing 
      in different litigations may not necessarily be the same company.</p>
    <p>As the pioneered service provider, 
      DCM possesses the expertise and additional information sources to 
      verify which of the retrieved defendants of similar spelling in 
      different civil litigations are one &amp; the same person/company.
