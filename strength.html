            <h2>Our strengths contribute to our growth and good services to clients</h2>    
            
            <p>For its 45 years of operations, DCM has attributed its progress to a leading risk management and consulting company to good management, practical experience, business insights and a huge database unrivalled in the region.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Management</strong>  - DCM has been steadily managed by the same team of credit veterans educated in prestigious local or overseas universities. They have good practical experience in credit risk, receivable management, frauds investigation and investment consultancy; and are capable to uphold professional practices and spearhead new services to cater for the changing needs of our clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Effective and Efficient Staff</strong> -DCM operates a prudent employment system and intensive training programme which has nurtured an effective and proficient team of credit analysts, investigators, researchers and management consultants.</li>
                <li><strong>Outstanding China Strengths</strong> - DCM is a pioneer in China’s credit risk management business, and over the years, has earned considerable practical experience, well established operations and close contacts with various government sectors in China.  DCM also trained up a pool of resident staff in China.</li>
                <li><strong>Excellent International Network</strong> - Through affiliating with 50 leading agents overseas, DCM has access to millions of company reports and can conduct investigations in more than 150 countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Substantial Database</strong> - As the first-mover in the market, DCM has accumulated since 1977 millions credit files and civil litigation records. One of the largest and most accurate in Asia, the DCＭ database contains investigation reports, bankruptcy/ windup records, civil litigation reports, property search reports, company credit reports and registration records; and ensures timely and accurate credit information and cost-effective investigation services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With extensive experience in the credit assessment industry, DCM has launched its own Credit Assessment Index (CAI) since 2013.  Based on over 80,000 carefully assessed credit ratings that DCM has provided then for various kinds of companies, the CAI serves as a useful tool in risk prediction and management.</p>
